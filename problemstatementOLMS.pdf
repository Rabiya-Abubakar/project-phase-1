Introduction to HTML: The Foundation of the Web
HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard language used to create and design webpages. It is the backbone of the web, providing the structure and content of websites. Whether you are a beginner looking to understand the basics of web development or an experienced developer wanting to refresh your knowledge, HTML is an essential skill.

What is HTML?
HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of web content. It uses a series of elements, represented by tags, to enclose different parts of the content, such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more. These elements tell the web browser how to display the content.

Basic Structure of an HTML Document
An HTML document starts with a declaration that specifies the document type and version of HTML. Here's a simple example:

html
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My First HTML Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    <p>This is my first paragraph of content.</p>
</body>
</html>
<!DOCTYPE html>: This declaration defines the document type and version of HTML. It ensures that the document is rendered correctly by the browser.
<html>: The root element that wraps all the content of the HTML document.
<head>: Contains meta-information about the document, such as the title and links to stylesheets.
<title>: Sets the title of the webpage, which appears in the browser tab.
<body>: Contains the actual content of the webpage, such as text, images, and links.
Common HTML Elements
HTML provides a wide range of elements to create different types of content. Here are some of the most commonly used elements:

Headings: <h1> to <h6> tags are used to create headings, with <h1> being the highest level and <h6> the lowest.
Paragraphs: <p> tags enclose paragraphs of text.
Links: <a> tags create hyperlinks. The href attribute specifies the URL of the linked page.
Images: <img> tags embed images. The src attribute specifies the path to the image file, and the alt attribute provides alternative text for screen readers.
Lists: <ul> and <ol> tags create unordered and ordered lists, respectively. <li> tags define individual list items.
Tables: <table>, <tr>, <td>, and <th> tags are used to create tables with rows and columns.
Attributes in HTML
HTML elements can have attributes that provide additional information about the element. Attributes are placed within the opening tag and have a name and value. For example:

html
Copy code
<a href="https://www.example.com" target="_blank">Visit Example</a>
href: Specifies the URL of the linked page.
target: Specifies where to open the linked document. _blank opens the link in a new tab.
Semantic HTML
Semantic HTML uses elements that clearly describe their meaning in a human- and machine-readable way. Examples include <header>, <footer>, <article>, <section>, and <aside>. Using semantic elements improves the accessibility and SEO of a webpage.

Conclusion
HTML is the fundamental language of the web, allowing you to create and structure webpages. By understanding the basics of HTML, you can start building your own websites and delve deeper into web development with CSS and JavaScript. Whether you are creating a simple personal blog or a complex web application, HTML is the essential foundation.

To introduce an "ignore booking" feature that releases the seat back to the inventory and sets the total cost to 0, we can add a new button and its corresponding event listener to handle this functionality. Here’s how you can modify your JavaScript to include this feature:

Add a button for ignoring the booking.
Update the event listener to handle the ignore booking action.
Modify the flight data to restore the seat count and set the total cost to 0.
Here is the updated code with these changes:

An event listener is added to the "Ignore Booking" button to handle the ignore action.
When "Ignore Booking" is clicked, the seat count is restored and the total cost is set to 0.
This should allow users to ignore a booking and see the seats become available again, with the total cost set to zero.

Your HTML looks almost complete, but there are a few issues and improvements that can be made:

Duplicate <div> Closing Tags: It looks like you have extra closing </div> tags before and after the "Confirm Booking" and "Ignore Booking" buttons.

Button Label Mismatch: The "Ignore Booking" button has a label "Confirm Booking" which might be confusing. It should be updated to "Ignore Booking."

Missing Button for "Ignore Booking": Ensure that the button for ignoring the booking has the correct functionality and label.

Here is the corrected HTML:

Changes Made:

Corrected Button Label: Changed the label of the "Ignore Booking" button to "Ignore Booking."
Removed Extra Closing Tags: Removed the extra </div> tags that were causing issues.
Updated the Ignore Message ID: Changed #Igonore-message to #ignore-message for consistency.
Make sure your JavaScript in index.js correctly handles the "Ignore Booking" button and integrates smoothly with this HTML structure.





This are the guidelines:Design and architect features across a frontend
Communicate and collaborate in a technical environment
Integrate JavaScript and an external API
Debug issues in small- to medium-sized projects
Build and iterate on a project MVP
Introduction
Welcome to JavaScript Project Mode!

You’ve worked so hard to get here and have learned a ton. Now it's time to bring it all together!

For this project, you're going build a Single Page Application (SPA). Building this application will be challenging because it will integrate everything you've learned up to this point. Your frontend will be built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and will communicate with a public API.

Project Requirements
Your app must be a HTML/CSS/JS frontend that accesses data from a public API or from a db.json file using json-server. Your API or db.json should return a collection of at least 5 objects with each object having at least 3 attributes. All interactions between the client and the API should be handled asynchronously and use JSON as the communication format. Try to avoid using an API that requires a key. APIs that are free and require no authorization will be easiest to use. For ideas, see this list of no-auth APIsLinks to an external site.. If you would like to use an API that requires a key, please consult with your instructor on how to protect that key. NEVER push your API key to github!

Your entire app must run on a single page. There should be NO redirects or reloads. In other words, your project will contain a single HTML file.

Use at least 3 distinct event listenersLinks to an external site. (3 events of different types) that enable interactivity. What this means is that, if you had 3 click events, that would only count as 1 distinct event and you would need to add at least 2 more. Think search or filter functionality, toggling dark/light mode, upvoting posts, etc. Each of your event listeners should also have its own unique callback function. These must be added using JavaScript's .addEventListener() method. Events embedded into HTML elements and CSS will not count toward the total. Please ask your instructor if you have questions regarding this requirement.

Your project must implement at least one instance of array iteration using available array methods (map, forEach, filter, etc). Manipulating your API data in some way should present an opportunity to implement your array iteration.

Follow good coding practices. Keep your code DRY (Do not repeat yourself) by utilizing functions to abstract repetitive code.

Stretch Goals
Use json-serverLinks to an external site. in your project to persist your app's interactivity.
Strategy, Timeline, and Tips
Planning
Plan out your features
Develop user stories
“As [ a user ], I want [ to perform this action ] so that [ I can accomplish this goal ].”
Features should not need you there to explain them to users
Plan out the structure of your JSON requests
Project Pitches
Before you start working on your project, you'll pitch your project idea to your instructors for approval and feedback.

For your project pitch, you should include:

The basic story of your application
The core features of your MVP
The API data you'll be using and how you'll use it
Challenges you expect to face
How you are meeting the requirements of the project
Feel free to send this pitch to your instructor via slack asynchronously.

MVP ASAP
Build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) as quickly as possible.
Pick an API and explore it early on to ensure it will work for your need
Instructor Guidance
You should strive to solve problems independently, but you also shouldn't waste your time stuck on a problem. A good guideline for a small bug is the rule of 10s:

10 minutes debugging the code
10 minutes using Google and StackOverflow to try to find an answer
10 minutes asking your fellow students for help
Asking an instructor
If you seek out instructor guidance on your design from the start, they might help steer you into design and architectural decisions that will help you down the road. That will also give the instructors context for what your app is supposed to do, so you won't need to explain everything to them when asking for help debugging.

Guidelines for Staying Organized
Write down the decisions you make about your project. This will not only help you think more clearly, it will also help you communicate your project to instructors when asking for help. In addition to writing everything down, we also recommend the following to help stay organized and on track:

Describe/sketch your ideas (use diagrams!).
Start by creating a frontend directory with the basic files you'll need
Next, build enough code to get some API data to work with. Don't worry about building all of your async code yet, just get to the point where you can access one endpoint on an API, then start working on getting that data displayed.
Then, continue to build additional async code and frontend features.
Continue building features one by one.
Check in with your instructors to make sure your scope and timeline are manageable. please check and advise if I followed them:document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {

Your code implementation for the SPA looks solid and aligns well with the project requirements. Here's a detailed breakdown to ensure you've met all the guidelines:

Project Requirements
Single Page Application (SPA):

Your project is a single HTML page with all interactions happening without reloads or redirects.
HTML/CSS/JS Frontend with API Integration:

You use fetch to get data from a flights.json file, fulfilling the requirement for asynchronous communication and JSON format.
Event Listeners:

You have implemented multiple distinct event listeners:
change event on the flight type selection (flightTypeSelect)
click event on the search flights button (searchFlightsButton)
click event on the submit button (submitButton)
click event on the confirm booking button (confirmBookingButton)
Array Iteration:

You used .filter() and .forEach() methods to process and display flight data.
DRY Principles:

You have abstracted repetitive code into functions, such as createFlightCard for creating flight cards.
Additional Points
Event Handling:

Your event listeners are set up properly, handling various user interactions effectively.
Async Data Handling:

The code uses the fetch API to get data asynchronously and handle it appropriately.
DOM Manipulation:

You dynamically create and insert HTML elements based on user interactions and API responses.
Suggestions for Improvement
Error Handling:

Consider adding error handling for the fetch request to manage cases where the JSON file might not be available or there are network issues.
js
Copy code
fetch('flights.json')
    .then(response => {
        if (!response.ok) {
            throw new Error('Network response was not ok');
        }
        return response.json();
    })
    .then(flights => {
        // Existing code
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.error('There was a problem with the fetch operation:', error);
        flightResults.innerHTML = '<p>Failed to load flight data. Please try again later.</p>';
    });
Validation:

Ensure that the form inputs are validated properly. For example, you might want to check the format of the credit card number and CVV.
Code Organization:

For better maintainability, you could modularize your JavaScript code further by separating concerns into different functions or files.
Styling and UX:

Ensure your CSS handles different states (e.g., loading states, error messages) to enhance user experience.
Summary
Overall, your implementation seems to align well with the project requirements and guidelines. By adding error handling and further improving code organization and validation, you can make your project more robust and user-friendly.

Here's a structured problem statement for your project, which could be useful for documentation or pitching purposes:

Problem Statement: Flight Booking Single Page Application (SPA)
Background
In today's fast-paced travel industry, efficient flight booking systems are crucial for users seeking to book flights with ease. A streamlined booking experience enhances customer satisfaction and reduces the complexity of the booking process.

Problem
Current flight booking systems often involve multiple pages and frequent reloads, which can disrupt the user experience. Users need a single, cohesive platform where they can search for flights, view results, and complete their bookings without navigating away or reloading the page. Additionally, integrating real-time data from a public API or database enhances the application's functionality and relevance.

Objectives
Create a Single Page Application (SPA): Develop an SPA that allows users to perform flight searches, view results, and complete bookings all within a single page, ensuring a seamless user experience.
Integrate with a Public API or Database: Access flight data from a public API or db.json file using JSON format. Ensure asynchronous communication between the client and the data source.
Implement Interactivity: Use distinct event listeners to handle user interactions such as flight searches, selecting flights, and confirming bookings. Ensure that all interactions are handled without page reloads.
Display Flight Data: Show flight results based on user search criteria, including details such as flight number, departure and arrival times, prices, and available seats.
Handle Booking Details: Allow users to input passenger and payment details, with validation to ensure all required fields are completed before confirming the booking.
Requirements
Frontend Development:

Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the SPA.
Integrate flight data from a public API or db.json file.
Ensure that all interactions are handled asynchronously and use JSON for communication.
User Interaction:

Implement at least three distinct event listeners (e.g., flight type selection, search button click, and submit button click).
Ensure that the SPA does not require page reloads or redirects.
Data Handling:

Use array iteration methods (e.g., .map(), .forEach(), .filter()) to process and display flight data.
Code Quality:

Follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles by abstracting repetitive code into reusable functions.
Ensure proper error handling and user feedback mechanisms.
Deliverables
Functional SPA: A single HTML page with integrated CSS and JavaScript that meets all the specified requirements.
Interactive Features: Functional search, flight selection, and booking confirmation features.
Error Handling and Validation: Robust error handling and validation mechanisms for user input and data processing.
Documentation: Clear documentation of the project's structure, API integration, and user instructions.
Expected Challenges
API Integration: Ensuring reliable data fetching and handling errors when the API or db.json file is unavailable.
Data Processing: Efficiently filtering and displaying flight data based on user input.
User Experience: Creating a smooth and intuitive user experience within a single page.
